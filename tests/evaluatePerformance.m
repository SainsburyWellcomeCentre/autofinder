function varargout = evaluatePerformance(referenceDir,testDir)
    % Evaluates the performance of two directories and returns pass/fail info to screen
    %
    % function passedAllTests = evaluatePerformance(referenceDir,testDir)
    %
    % Purpose
    % Does a basic test of a test directory and reports whether or not it does
    % worse than a reference directory. This function is to be used like a unit test. 
    % In practice, it will be called by runEvaluation
    %
    %
    % Inputs
    % referenceDir - the reference (known good) directory
    % testDir - the directory being assessed
    %
    %
    % Outputs (optional)
    % passedAllTests - boolean. If true, all tests were passed. False otherwise.
    % msgString - String containing all text displayed to screen when function is run.
