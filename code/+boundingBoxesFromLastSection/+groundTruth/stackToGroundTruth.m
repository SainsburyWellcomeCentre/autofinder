function pStack = stackToGroundTruth(imStack,pathToRecipe,nSamples)
% Wrap an image stack into a "ground truth" structure (pStack) for testing
%
% boundingBoxesFromLastSection.groundTruth.stackToGroundTruth(imStack,pathToRecipe,nSamples)
%
% Purpose
% The "groundTruth" structure will be used for testing the behavior of the brain-finding
% algorithm. This function produces the structure. The structure should contain all the 
% parameters we need to obtain a ground truth brain border against which we can go on to 
% test whether or not the auto-brain-finder has managed to identify the whole brain. 
%
% 
% Inputs
% imStack - The preview image stack produced by previewFilesToTiffStack from BakingTray.
% pathToRecipe - Path to this sample's recipe file
% nSamples - the number of samples (e.g. brains) contained in imStack. Some acquisitions 
%            have multiple samples. 
%

% TODO (BAD) the following will work on SWC rigs for sure but maybe not elsewhere. 
% If X/Y are flipped for some reason. 
% TODO - it also may not be valid once we start to use the auto finder
