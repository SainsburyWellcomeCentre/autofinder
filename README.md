Test of algorithm to image only a sample and not surrounding tissue using serial-section 2-photon imaging. 


# Generating pStack files
The command `boundingBoxesFromLastSection.test.runOnStackStruct(pStack)` calculates bounding boxes for 
a whole image stack. 
The input argument `pStack` is a structure which needs to be generated by the user. 
It's a good idea to generate these and store to disk in some reasonable way. 
e.g. Inside sub-directories divided up however makes sense, such as one directory containing all acquisitions of single samples, one with two samples, etc. 
To generate the pStack files do the following


We will work with imaging stacks (`imStack`, below) obtained from the BakingTray preview stacks. 

```
>> nSamples=1;
>> pStack = boundingBoxesFromLastSection.test.stackToGroundTruth(imStack,'/pathTo/recipeFile',nSamples)
```
